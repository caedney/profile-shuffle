Here I run badminton and have a hand in the Hudson Society, UCAS, Oxbridge linguist preparation, 6.1 debating and JC tennis. Away from school, I still believe that one day I will read all of Proust’s À la recherche du temps perdu.</p>

I worked in the private sector for 20 years and in 2005 became a partner with Ridge in Oxford, joining Radley in October 2008.

One of our best accomplishments was the redevelopment of the Old Gym, where we now have an outstanding new building, Clock Tower Court.</p>

              <p>After Newcastle Royal Grammar School, I studied chemistry at Oxford. I then moved into the banking sector where I spent many enjoyable years in a variety of roles. Looking for a new challenge, I was appointed Bursar in September 2008 and am responsible for overseeing the financial and operational aspects of the College and the management of the non-teaching staff. There is never a dull day.</p>
              <p>I am married to Jillian and we have a young son, Philip. In the occasional spare time I can find, I enjoy playing real tennis (in the College’s excellent sports centre) as well as running.</p>

              <p>After 20 years working for an international firm of chartered accountants, I decided to return to studying and gained a degree in human resource management. I have worked in HR since 2000 and joined Radley in 2004. With a small team working with me, we are responsible for all aspects of employment for more than 400 teaching and non-teaching staff. Nobody can say this job doesn’t bring new experiences.</p>
