              <p>Following six good years of student life, leading to a degree from Oxford University and a PhD from Durham, investigating the chemistry of rocks from Greenland, I worked for Esso as an exploration geophysicist, analysing data to find more gas reserves in the North Sea. Deciding that sitting behind a desk and computer did not quite offer the variety and stimulation that I wanted from life, I took the plunge and started a new career in teaching, and have been at Radley since 1993. As well as being Head of Geology, I also teach chemistry to IGCSE and look after lower-end rugby and cricket teams.</p>
              <p>In the holidays I normally spend a ludicrous amount of time, money, and effort with my wife climbing Alpine mountains in both summer and winter.</p>

              <p>I first encountered the game of Fives in Roald Dahl’s wonderful early autobiography, Boy, in which he writes:</p>
              <p>“Fives is possibly the fastest ball-game on earth, far faster than squash, and the little ball ricochets around the court at such a speed that sometimes you can hardly see it. You need a swift eye, strong wrists and a very quick pair of hands to play fives well, and it was a game I took to right from the beginning.”</p>
              <p>When I started at Ipswich School, I was very pleased to discover the Eton Fives courts, and proceeded to spend far too much time up at that end of the school. I had moderate success as a schoolboy, winning some smaller events and taking part in the National Championships. I continued playing Eton Fives throughout my university career, as well as playing for the Old Ipswichians. Winchester and Rugby Fives were both new to me when I joined Radley, and I have greatly enjoyed getting to grips with these varieties of the game</p>
